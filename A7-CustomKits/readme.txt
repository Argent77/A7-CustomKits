1. General Overview
This mod adds new kits to the Baldur’s Gate game.
Fighter kits:
- Spellsword (provided as a nerfed and an original version):
    Not all fighters rely only on their physical prowess. Some of them also 
    train their mind to use effectively in battle by creating spiritual weapons 
    or clones of themselves. That makes them a dangerous opponent in all situations.

    Abilities: 
    - Creates a spiritual weapons of his choice (starting on level 3)
    - Original version only: Summons a Blade Spirit which acts independently of the fighter (starting on level 8)
    - Creates a clone of him/herself (starting at level 18)
    For more detailed information look at the kit description in-game.

More kits were planned, but ultimately not realized.


2. Installation instructions
- Unpack directly into your Baldur’s Gate II (or Tutu/BGT) folder.
- Execute Setup-A7-CustomKits.exe in your BG2 root folder and follow the instructions.
- To uninstall the mod, just call Setup-A7-CustomKits.exe again and select the uninstall option(s).


3. Compatibility issues
This mod has been tested on BG2 (SoA and ToB), EasyTutu and Baldur's Gate Trilogy without problems.
The BG2 engine is limited to 9 kits per class on the character generation menu, 
so any kit that exceeds that limit won’t be displayed.
