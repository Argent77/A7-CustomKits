General Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This mod adds new kits to the Baldur’s Gate games (and IWD:EE).
Fighter kits:
- Spellsword (provided as a nerfed and an original version):
    Not all fighters rely only on their physical prowess. Some of them also 
    train their mind to use effectively in battle by creating spiritual weapons 
    or clones of themselves. That makes them a dangerous opponent in all situations.

    Abilities: 
    - Creates a spiritual weapons of his choice (starting on level 3)
    - Original version only: Summons a Blade Spirit which acts independently of the fighter (starting on level 8)
    - Creates a clone of him/herself (starting at level 18)
    For more detailed information look at the kit description in-game.

More kits were planned, but ultimately not realized.


Notes for Siege of Dragonspear (SoD)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GOG and Steam both install the Siege of Dragonspear expansion in a way that is not moddable out of the box.
You must install a mod called DLC Merger (https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases/latest) on your
SoD installation before this or any other WeiDU-based mods can be installed.


Installation instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a WeiDU mod, that means it is very easy to install. Simply unpack the zip file into the installation directory
of your game and run either "setup-A7-CustomKits.exe" (Windows) or "setup-A7-CustomKits.command" (macOS). Follow the
instructions, and you are ready to start.

To uninstall, run "setup-A7-CustomKits.exe" or "setup-A7-CustomKits.command" again and follow the prompts.


Compatibility issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This mod has been tested on BG2 (SoA and ToB), EasyTutu, Baldur's Gate Trilogy and the Enhanced Editions without
problems. The original BG2 engine is limited to 9 kits per class on the character generation menu, so any kit
that exceeds that limit won’t be displayed.
